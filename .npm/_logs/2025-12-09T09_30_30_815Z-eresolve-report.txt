# npm resolution error report

While resolving: angular-demo@1.0.0
Found: zone.js@0.13.3
node_modules/zone.js
  zone.js@"~0.13.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer zone.js@"^0.10.2 || ^0.11.0" from @opentelemetry/context-zone-peer-dep@1.9.0
node_modules/@opentelemetry/context-zone-peer-dep
  @opentelemetry/context-zone-peer-dep@"1.9.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
